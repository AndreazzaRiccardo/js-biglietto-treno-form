### EXERCISE
### Ask the user how many miles he will have to travel and his age. Based on this information, calculate the price of a train ticket, considering that: 
1. The ticket price is 0.21â‚¬ per km
2. Minors will receive a 20% discount
3. Persons over 65 will receive a 40% discount

**Data collection**
1. Ask the user how many kilometres he has to travel;
2. Ask the user how old he is;

**Logic of the solution***
1. Multiply the estimated mileage by the price per kilometre of the ticket;
2. Where appropriate, calculate a discount if the user belongs to one of the categories described;
3. Deduct the calculated discount from the total price;
4. Prepare the message containing the finished price;

**Output**
Print the final user fee on the screen
